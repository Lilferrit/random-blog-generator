      <h1>Random Blog Post Generator</h1>
      <p>
        Are you tired of writing your own blog post, papers, or professional memos? Are you
        the creater of online recipes and you need some filler text to pad your google
        search metrics and get that sweet sweet ad revenue? If you answered yes to any of those
        questions, then look no further than this blog creater tool! I'm confident that this tool
        will save you time and change your life. Don't believe me? Well here's a quick rundown of
        some of the features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>All text will be generated containing words that you enter in the word bank.</li>
        <li>To remove a word, simply double click it.</li>
        <li>To increase the frequency of a word, add it to the wordbank multiple times.</li>
        <li>
          In the rare event that you aren't completely satisfied with the output of this tool,
          simply double click on any element in your blog to remove it!
        </li>
        <li>
          Want to make your users eyes bleed? Click on any list or paragraph
          to change it's font to comic-sans (actually comic-nua, but the effect as at least 80% the
          same)!
        </li>
        <li>
          How about a flashback to the 90s? Click on any section header in your blog to make it
          marque across the page!
        </li>
        <li>
          Want your blog to appeal to the younger demographic? Use the generate meme
          button to add a random popular meme to your blogpost! You'll be getting those clicks in no
          time! All memes are are pulled from the <a href="https://imgflip.com/api"> memes api.</a>
          (Discaimer: The Random Blog Post generator does not provide any gurantee on the
          number of clicks gained by using the genereate meme functionality.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>New!</em> this is pherhaps our biggest update yet; users now have the ability to save
          and delete their wordbanks, as well as using other's wordbanks to craft their high
          quality blogpost. Saving and deleting wordbanks requires a password. This Password
          is stored as plain text, so it is ill-advised to use a password that you care about. On
          the other hand, loading wordbanks does not require a password, so you can use any
          wordbank to create a blogpost. To see a list of available wordbanks, simply click
          the "load word bak list" button!
